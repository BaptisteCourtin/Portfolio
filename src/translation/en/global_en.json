    "AlternanceTitre": "Alternance",
    "AlternanceDate": "october 2023 - november 2024",
    "AlternanceDesc1": "Following my training at the Wild Code School and my internship, I decided to continue my training on a sandwich course. The school was still at the Wild Code School, and the company was Inovaxo.",
    "AlternanceDesc2": "The rhythm was 3 weeks at the company for 1 week of classes.",
    "AlternanceDesc3": "The school: We started with a project to learn how to use the new tools we'd be needing later on, as well as a refresher on what we'd learned during the first course. Then, in groups of 4, we worked on a project that lasted until the end of the course.",
    "AlternanceDesc4": "The company: I didn't find a work-study program in javascript to match the training. I mainly worked on projects already in place in Java or PHP. I developed new features and fixed bugs.",

    "AubayTitre": "Internship at Aubay",
    "AubayDate": "february 2023 - august 2023",
    "AubayDesc1": "In addition to my training, I was able to complete a 6-month internship with Aubay, during which I helped create the internship showcase site. The aim is to present the interns' projects to customers and future interns",
    "AubayDesc2": "This gave me an insight into how a company works, its methods and constraints. I worked with 2 other full-stack trainees and a design trainee. There was also a PO and a lead developer when we needed them.",
    "AubayDesc3": "The technical stack was different from that learned during the training. So we had to start with training on Angular, TypeScript and above all Java Springboot. I didn't have any particular problems with Angular and TypeScript, as I already knew React and JavaScript. Even if there are some notable differences, it's easy to find your way around. When it came to Java and Springboot, on the other hand, getting started was more complicated, but I managed to get the hang of it.",
    "AubayDesc4": "One of the most important points I had to learn and implement during this internship was front and back-end unit testing. It took me a while to get used to that too, but in the end I succeeded.",

    "WCSTitre": "My training at Wild Code School",
    "WCSDate": "september 2022 - february 2023",
    "WCSDesc1": "My training to become a full-stack web developer took place over 5 months at the Wild Code School in Nantes. There we learned to code, starting with the basics such as html and css as well as javascript in dom. Then we continued with React for the front end and Express for the back end.",
    "WCSDesc2": "This learning process is based on courses, but above all on exercises and lots of hands-on practice through 3 projects (which you can find in the 'my projects' section). These projects are carried out in groups of 4 or 5 and cover everything we've seen, and even more because they push us to go and find what we need on our own.",
    "WCSDesc3": "What's more, we worked on good coding practices and the importance of technology watch.",
    "WCSDesc4": "We also learned about agile methods, in particular with Jira.",

    "FacTitre": "The university - EEEA",
    "FacDate": "september 2019 - june 2022",
    "FacDesc1": "EEEA stands for Électronique, énergie électrique, automatique. It was thanks to the C language module in this course that I found my calling. It made me want to continue coding and, later on, do web development.",
    "FacDesc2": "I've got a degree, but I don't have a bachelor's degree. Careful explanation: I've validated the first and third years as well as the second semester of the second year. So I'm missing the first half of the second year.",
    "FacDesc3": "In short, it has nothing to do with my web development skills. I'm putting it here just to say that I have done something for 3 years.",

    "CertifTitre": "My certifications",

    "Certif1Titre": "TOEIC",
    "Certif1Date": "april 2022",
    "Certif1Desc": "At least university enabled me to take the TOEIC exam. I got 820 out of 990 points. Which is equivalent to a B2 level.",
    "Certif1Doc": "The document that says it's true",

    "Certif2Titre": "Web and mobile web developer certification",
    "Certif2Date": "september 2023",
    "Certif2Desc": "I passed my web and mobile web developer certification on 1 September. It's equivalent to a 2-year higher education qualification.",
